        "She plays the 3 slot machines in turn.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first machine pays 30 quarters for every 35th play.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second machine pays 60 quarters for every 100th play.\n",
        "\n",
        "The third and final machine pays 9 quarters for every 10th play.\n",
        "\n",
        "The program will ask the user to input how many plays each machine has before Martha begins playing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, this program will calculate how many times Martha plays the machines before running out of quarters.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Language:** Python\n",

        "*What I did:* I created variables to store the user-inputted amounts for the quarters to start with and numbers on each of the 3 machines. Then I created a loop to run until Martha is out of quarters. The code runs through if/else statements on each machine incrementing plays and rewarding wins along the way until Martha is out of quarters. Then a final print will state how many plays were conducted by Martha until number_of_quarters = 0.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Computational Concepts / Practices:* The aspects of computation concepts / practices I relied on included: conditional to check if Martha still had a quarter to play the machine, loops to continue running the program as long as Martha had > 0 quarters to play, operators to compare the count of quarters to 0, data to store user inputted values, number of quarters, and count of plays on each machine. Then I employed experimenting, iterating, debugging, reusing, remixing all in constant rotation to write the write in code especially in the execution cell."
