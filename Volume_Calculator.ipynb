I used if statements to tree out into different user prompted based on the chosen shape and wrote equations and store into variable to then be printed in a formatted string with the final calculated volume.\n",

        "*Computational Concepts / Practices:* The aspect of computational concepts / practices I related on included: conditional to branch out the code based on user inputted shape choice, data to store values into variables. Then I employed experimenting, iterating, debugging, reusing, remixing all in constant rotation to write the write in code especially in the execution cell."
